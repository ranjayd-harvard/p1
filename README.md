This is the first project(p1) for the dwa15 class. This project is a single-page web application with information about the student and other projects links. It is built per the instructions of the demo ( http://dwa15.com/Projects.../P1) and built using the basic HTML5/CSS/JS. For the layout of the page, i have used the bootstrap grid technique ( more details on this https://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/ )
